## Introduction to Javascript
1. #### What is JavaScript?
    JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to add interact with element of web pages.
    It consists of three part :
    1. ECMASCRIPT
    2. DOM( Document Object Model) provides interface to interact with element on web pages.
    3. BOM(Browser Object Model ) provides the browser API for interaction with the web browser.

2. #### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
    In-browser JavaScript is able to: 
    1. Add new HTML to the page, change the existing    content, modify styles.
    2. React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
    3. Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files.
    4. Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
    5. Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
3. #### What can't in-browser JavaScript do?
    . It cann't read/write files on hardisk, copy them or execute programs.
    . JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side.Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
## JavaScript Fundamental
1. #### Variable
    Variable are used to store the value in any programming language. Let keyword is used to create the variable. Variable name should not contain any reserved keyword and start with number.
2. #### Data Types
    Javascript has following data types:
    i. null
    ii. undefined
    iii. number
    iv. bigint
    v. string
    vi. boolean
    vii. symbol
    viii. object
3. #### Type Conversion
    The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

    String Conversion – Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with String(value). The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

    Numeric Conversion – Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with Number(value).

    Boolean Conversion – Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with Boolean(value).


4. #### Operators
    Javascript operators are:
    
    i. Arithmetic Operators
    ii. Comparison Operators
    iii. Logical Operators
    iv. Assignment Operators
    v. Conditional Operators
    vi. Ternary Operator
    vii. Nullish coalescing operator '??'
5. #### Conditional Branching
6. #### Loops

7. #### Function
    Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
