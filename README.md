## Introduction to Javascript
1. #### What is JavaScript?
    JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to add interact with element of web pages.
    It consists of three part :
    1. ECMASCRIPT
    2. DOM( Document Object Model) provides interface to interact with element on web pages.
    3. BOM(Browser Object Model ) provides the browser API for interaction with the web browser.

2. #### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
    In-browser JavaScript is able to: 
    1. Add new HTML to the page, change the existing    content, modify styles.
    2. React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
    3. Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files.
    4. Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
    5. Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
3. #### What can't in-browser JavaScript do?
    . It cann't read/write files on hardisk, copy them or execute programs.
    . JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side.Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
